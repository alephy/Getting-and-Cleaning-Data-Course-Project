This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up
the source data to create the tidy dataset.

Original data description
==================================================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Original data contains:
=========================================

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

    Functions of_analysis.R Script
    
    1. Read metadata: features and activities
    2. Read the test and train raw data in memory
    3. Merge all data into one dataframe (rbind, cbind used)
    How this looks:
    
                head(complete[1:5])
            subject activity tBodyAcc-mean()-X tBodyAcc-mean()-Y tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

    4. Name columns after feature: extracted from features and renamed columns
    5. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
          grep function used to search for occurance of mean mean() and standard deviation std()
      End up with a new dataframe called newDataFrame with 10299 observations and 68 variables
    6. delete the meanFreq columns
    7- Make tidy dataframe
        label variable names to deccriptive terms so that it will be as below:
               head(names(tidyframe))
          [1] "subject"           "activity"          "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
          [4] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X"
  
   Details of the tidy dataframe:
              head(tidyframe[1:4])
          subject activity tBodyAcc-mean()-X tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
